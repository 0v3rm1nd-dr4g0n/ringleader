Service Commands
================

Introduction
------------
Service Commands are a way of creating commands (e.g. GCLI commands) from a web service.

Commands are defined in a JSON descriptor (which looks a little like a GCLI [command definition](https://github.com/mozilla/gcli/blob/master/docs/writing-commands.md))
